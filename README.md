# MBTI
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:
Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)
Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)
The purpose of this dataset is to help see if any patterns can be detected in specific types and their style of writing, which overall explores the validity of the test in analysing, predicting or categorising behaviour.The dataset contains ~8600 observations (people), where each observation gives a person’s:
Myers-Briggs personality type (as a 4-letter code)
An excerpt containing the last 50 posts on their PersonalityCafe forum (each entry separated by “|||”)
This data was collected through the PersonalityCafe forum, as it provides a large selection of people and their MBTI personality type, as well as what they have written.
Some basic uses could include:
Use machine learning to evaluate the MBTIs validity and ability to predict language styles and behaviour online.
Production of a machine learning algorithm that can attempt to determine a person’s personality type based on some text they have written.
